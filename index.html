    <h2 id="makeCalendar">Making a Calendar and Appointment Slots in Google Calendar</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Go to <a href="http://google.gustavus.edu" target="_blank">http://google.gustavus.edu</a>. Log in using your Gustavus username and password. This will bring you to the calendar page of your Google account.</li>
     <li>To create a new calendar select the arrow next to the "My Calendars" box and then click "Create New Calendar." This will bring you to a new menu where you will be able to create a calendar to store your study abroad appointments.</li>
     <li>To create appointment slots click the allotted time on the calendar when you are available. A box will appear. At the top of the box chose the "Appointment Slots" link in blue.</li>
     <li>In the "What" field, type in the name of the advisor who the appointment is with followed by a dash and then a description. For example, to make appointments for an advisor named John Doe, enter "John Doe - Peer Advising" or the like into the "What" field. Students who are looking to make an appointment will see this as the title of the slot they are signing up for. This formatting is necessary for the right information to be stored in the spreadsheet down the road, unless the advisor information is not desired.</li>
     <li>The time, place, and description for the appointment can be set when creating the appointment slots or they can be edited at a later date by clicking on the appointment block on the calendar and selecting "Edit Details." Anything typed into the "Description" box will be displayed to students signing up for appointments. You can use this space to have them fill in any additional information you would like about their appointment. That information will later be stored in the spreadsheet.</li>
     <li>A link to the appointment calendar can be found by clicking on the "Edit Details" option of an appointment. This link will take people to a page that lets them see what time slots are available and sign-up for appointments. The link can be emailed to people or linked to from a webpage.</li>
     <li>Students will automatically receive an email when they sign up for an appointment slot reminding them of their appointment.</li>
    </ol>

To use the store appointments program with your peer advisors, create another calendar as we described in the tutorial and share it amongst all of the advisors. You can also share the spreadsheet with them if you would like and all of you will be able to update it. Make sure everyone saves the created appointments to the shared calendar and not their personal calendars and everything will work properly.

    <h2 id="section2">Creating a Spreadsheet</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Go to <a href="http://google.gustavus.edu" target="_blank">http://google.gustavus.edu</a>. Log in using your Gustavus username and password.</li>
       <li>Select the Documents tab at the top of the page.</li>
       <li>Click the Create button and select "From template...".</li>
       <li>Select either the "Store Appointments" template or the "Store Appointments Without Advisor" template. The difference is that the "Without Advisor" version omits the "Advisor" column derived from appointment titles.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="importData">Using Store Appointments to Import Data into a Google Docs Spreadsheet</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Go to <a href="http://google.gustavus.edu" target="_blank">http://google.gustavus.edu</a>. Log in using your Gustavus username and password.</li>
       <li>Select the Documents tab at the top of the page.</li>
       <li>Click on the spreadsheet that you set up to store your appointments.</li>
       <li>In the tool bar, the "Import Appointments" and "Update Sheet" buttons will take a few seconds to appear. To create a new sheet of appointment data, click on the "Import Appointments" button.</li>
       <li>In the box that pops up, select the calendar where your study abroad appointments are stored. Select the start and end months you would like to pull the data from and then name the sheet. Then click submit.</li>
       <li>The sheet will fill with data from the date range you selected. The information appears as such:
           <ul>
              <li>The first column has the name of the student that made the appointment.</li>
              <li>The second has that student's email address.</li>
              <li>The third is the date of the appointment.</li>
              <li>The fourth and fifth are the times of that appointment.</li>
              <li>The notes column has what the student entered for the description field.</li>
              <li>The last column has the advisor with which the appointment was made. In spreadsheets created from the "Without Advisors" version of the template, the last column will be omitted.</li>
           </ul></li>
       <li>To gather appointment data from a different range of dates, you can repeat the process using the "Import Appointments" button. A new sheet will be created from the date range you input. To switch between existing sheets, simply select the appropriate tab at the bottom of the screen.</li>
       <li>A sheet with a particular date range can be updated to import any new events that have been added since it was initially created. Open the sheet you wish to update by clicking on its tab on the bottom of the screen. Then choose the "Update Sheet" button. *Note* Any manual changes you made to the sheet itself will be lost, as the update function repopulates the entire spreadsheet.</li>
       <li>The sheets can be downloaded and saved to a computer by choosing File -> Download -> and then selecting the format you would like to save the document as. Spreadsheets can also be shared among multiple people just like any other Google document.</li>
    </ol>
